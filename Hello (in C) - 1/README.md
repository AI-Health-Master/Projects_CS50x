# hello

This is my 1st programming assignment in C! Pretty simple, right??

This C program prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting in the format hello, <name>, e.g. `hello, Alice`.

Feel free to try!

## Skills and Learning
•	Captured and stored user input
•	Used printf with format specifiers to display personalized messages
•	Used the command line to compile (make hello) and run (./hello) C programs
