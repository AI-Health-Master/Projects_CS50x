# Mario Pyramid generator (in C) 

## Description:
A simple C program that prompts the user for the height of a pyramid (an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive) and prints in the console a left-aligned pyramid of that height made of # characters. The pyramid is similar in logic to the block patterns in Super Mario Bros.

## Key Concepts

- **User input validation with loops:** Ensuring the user enters an integer in the correct range
- **Nested loops:** Printing rows and columns to generate the pyramid pattern
- **Iteration and algorithmic thinking:** Practicing iteration and basic algorithmic thinking in C

Sample Output (height = 5):
