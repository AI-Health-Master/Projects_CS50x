# Cash Coin change (in C) 
A C program that prompts the user for a monetary amount of change owed (in dollars and cents) and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make that change, using standard U.S. coin denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). The program uses a greedy algorithm to determine the optimal solution.

- Implemented a greedy algorithm in C to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount
- Practiced user input validation, floating-point conversion, and modular arithmetic for efficient problem-solving


### Sample Output:
```bash
Change owed: 0.43

6
```
(Indicating 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies for a total of 6 coins)
