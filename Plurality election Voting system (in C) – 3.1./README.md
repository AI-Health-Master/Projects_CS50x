# Plurality election Voting system 
A C program that simulates a plurality election. The program takes candidate names as command-line arguments, then prompts the user for the number of voters and their votes. It updates vote counts for each candidate and determines the winner(s), which is the candidate with the highest number of votes. If thereâ€™s a tie, all winners are printed.



## Key Concepts:
-	String comparison (strcmp) and command-line argument handling
-	Data organization with Structs and arrays in C
-	Implementing vote tallying logic
-	Handling ties and output formatting
-	Iteration and conditional logic in C
