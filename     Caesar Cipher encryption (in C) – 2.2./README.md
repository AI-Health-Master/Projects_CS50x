# Caesar Cipher encryption
A C program that implements the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption technique. The program prompts the user for a key (a non-negative integer) as a command-line argument and then for a plaintext string. It outputs the ciphertext, shifting each alphabetical character by the given key while preserving case and leaving non-alphabetical characters unchanged.



## Key Concepts:
-	Command-line interface (CLI) argument parsing and input validation in C
-	Character manipulation using ASCII values and modular arithmetic
-	Implementing classical cryptographic algorithms (Caesar cipher)
-	Use of loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic


### Sample Output:

$ ./caesar 10

plaintext:  Meet me at the park at eleven am

ciphertext: Woon wo kd dro zkbu kd ovofox kw
