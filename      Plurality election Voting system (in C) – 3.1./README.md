# Plurality election Voting system 
A C program that simulates a plurality election. The program takes candidate names as command-line arguments, then prompts the user for the number of voters and their votes. It updates vote counts for each candidate and determines the winner(s), which is the candidate with the highest number of votes. If thereâ€™s a tie, all winners are printed.



## Key Concepts:
-	Command-line interface (CLI) argument parsing and input validation in C
-	Character manipulation using ASCII values and modular arithmetic
-	Implementing classical cryptographic algorithms (Caesar cipher)
-	Use of loops, conditionals, and modular arithmetic


### Sample Output:

$ ./caesar 10

plaintext:  Meet me at the park at eleven am

ciphertext: Woon wo kd dro zkbu kd ovofox kw
