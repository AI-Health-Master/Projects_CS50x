# hello (in C)

This is my 1st programming assignment in C! Pretty simple, right??

This straightforward C program asks the user for their name and displays a personalized greeting in the format: hello, <name>, e.g. `hello, Alice`.

Feel free to compile and try!

### Skills and Learning
-	Captured and stored user input
-	Used printf with format specifiers to display personalized messages
-	Used the command line to compile (make hello) and run (./hello) C programs
